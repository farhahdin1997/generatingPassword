Password Generator


Description <br>
Create a programme that generates a random password based on the user's preferences. This app will run in the browser and use your JavaScript code to dynamically change the HTML and CSS. It will also have a sophisticated user experience and will be responsive, meaning it will adjust to different screen sizes.
